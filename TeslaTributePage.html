                Serbian-American engineer and physicist Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) made dozens of breakthroughs in the
                production, transmission and application of electric power.
                </br>He invented the first alternating&nbspcurrent&nbsp(AC) motor and developed AC generation and
                transmission
                technology.
                </br> Nikola Tesla's work would go on to inspire thousands of inventors, dreamers and engineers.
                </br>To this very day, his inventions continue to shape life as we know it.

                Tesla invented, predicted or contributed to development of hundreds of technologies that play big parts
                in
                our
                daily lives -- like the remote control, neon and fluorescent lights, wireless transmission, computers,
                smartphones, laser beams, x-rays, robotics and, of course, alternating current, the basis of our
                present-day
                electrical system.

                    Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in Smiljan, Croatia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
                    </br>Tesla was the fourth child in a family of five children. The family comprised of three sisters
                    including
                    Marica, Angelina, Milka and his old brother who was known as Dane.
                    </br>Dane died when Tesla was still at a tender age. The shock of the loss unsettled the 7-year-old
                    Tesla.
                </p>
                <p>Nikola Tesla is believed to have been born at midnight. During his birth, lightning struck during a
                    summer
                    storm.
                    Born to a Serbian Family in Smiljan, Tesla was nicknamed `Child of the Storm`, by his aunt. That
                    said, his
                    mother replied to that comment by calling him `Child of the light`.

                <p>Tesla attended his early education in 1861 in smiljan, where he acquired various skills including
                    arithmetic
                    and he also mastered the German Language. The following year, Nikola Tesla moved to a place known as
                    Gospic.
                    Here, his father played the role of a Parish Pastor.

                <p>
                    In 1875, Tesla enrolled to a Polytechnic based on a military scholarship. He was a disciplined
                    student and
                    achieved the highest grades possible while passing various exams.
                    </br>Tesla studied math and physics at the Technical University of Graz and philosophy at the
                    University of
                    Prague.
